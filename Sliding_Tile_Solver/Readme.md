##Introduction
The sliding-tile puzzle consists of three black tiles, three white tiles, and an empty space in the configuration. The puzzle has two legal moves with associated costs:

1. A tile may' move into an adjacent empty location. 
2. A tile can hop over one or two other tiles into the empty' position. 

The goal is to have all the white tiles to the left of all the black tiles. The position of the blank is not important. All moves have exactly the same cost (= 1).
